Bituminous Concrete Mix Calculator

Overview:
I developed this web-based calculator to simplify the process of calculating bituminous concrete mix proportions for civil engineering projects. Using the Marshall Stability method, my application determines the correct quantities of Bitumen, Filler, Fine Aggregate, Coarse Aggregate, and Waste Plastic for a given mix.

What I Built:

* **Composition Calculator:** I created a feature where users can select the bitumen percentage, and the app calculates the exact material proportions automatically.
* **Mass Calculator:** I implemented functionality to calculate the volume and mass of a mould, given its diameter, height, and material density.
* **Excel Export:** I integrated XLSX.js and FileSaver.js so users can download the calculated results as an Excel sheet.
* **Responsive and Modern UI:** I designed the interface using CSS with gradients, shadows, and blur effects to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

How It Works:

1. Users select the desired bitumen percentage from the dropdown.
2. Clicking “Calculate the Composition” displays material weights in a table.
3. Entering the mould diameter, height, and density computes the mass.
4. Users can download the results as an Excel file for easy record-keeping.

Technologies I Used:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Libraries: XLSX.js, FileSaver.js

Challenges I Solved:

* Made calculations dynamic and responsive based on user input.
* Implemented Excel export functionality purely in JavaScript.
* Designed a user-friendly interface for technical users.

Outcome:
This project helped me combine web development skills with practical civil engineering knowledge, creating a tool that can be used for real-world construction calculations.
